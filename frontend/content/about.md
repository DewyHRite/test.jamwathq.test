# About JamWatHQ

**Your #1 Jamaican J-1 Visa Info Hub**

---

## 🇯🇲 Our Story

JamWatHQ was born from a simple observation: thousands of Jamaican students embark on J-1 work and travel programs each year, but finding reliable, Jamaica-specific information was surprisingly difficult.

As a Jamaican student who went through the J-1 process myself, I experienced firsthand the frustration of:
- **Scattered information** across multiple websites
- **Conflicting advice** from different sources
- **Generic guides** not tailored to Jamaican applicants
- **Lack of authentic experiences** from fellow Jamaicans
- **Uncertainty about agencies** and which ones to trust

I realized that what our community needed was a **centralized, trustworthy platform** that brings together:
- ✅ Accurate, up-to-date information about J-1 programs
- ✅ Real experiences from Jamaican participants
- ✅ A directory of verified agencies
- ✅ Guides written specifically for our context
- ✅ News and updates relevant to Jamaican applicants

So I built JamWatHQ — a platform **by Jamaicans, for Jamaicans** seeking J-1 opportunities.
