| Issue ID | Description | Severity | Date | Fix Applied | Status |
|----------|-------------|----------|------|-------------|--------|
| SR-2025-10-12-01 | Session cookies configure `sameSite` as `lax` and only enable `Secure` in production, violating mandated strict session handling requirements. | High | 2025-10-12T22:41:48.8451992Z | server.js enforces Secure/HttpOnly cookies with SameSite=strict (2025-10-12T23:08:05.4604257Z). | Mitigated (Pending QA) |
| SR-2025-10-12-02 | CSRF protections are absent on authenticated POST/DELETE routes (`/api/reviews`), exposing the API to cross-site request forgery. | High | 2025-10-12T22:41:48.8451992Z | server.js + auth-client.js add csurf middleware and token handling (2025-10-12T23:08:05.4604257Z). | Mitigated (Pending QA) |
| SR-2025-10-12-03 | No rate limiting or throttling is enforced on authentication endpoints, leaving the service vulnerable to brute-force and credential stuffing. | Medium | 2025-10-12T22:41:48.8451992Z | server.js applies express-rate-limit to /auth and /api (2025-10-12T23:08:05.4604257Z). | Mitigated (Pending QA) |
| SR-2025-10-12-04 | Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) and HTTPS redirects are not implemented, weakening transport layer protections. | High | 2025-10-12T22:41:48.8451992Z | server.js enables Helmet CSP/HSTS and HTTPS enforcement (2025-10-12T23:08:05.4604257Z). | Mitigated (Pending QA) |
| SR-2025-10-12-05 | Fallback credentials (email password, session secret) are hard-coded, risking accidental deployment with insecure secrets. | High | 2025-10-12T22:41:48.8451992Z | server.js now requires environment secrets; email fallback disabled (2025-10-12T23:08:05.4604257Z). | Mitigated (Pending QA) |
| SR-2025-10-12-06 | Administrative analytics/dashboard access logging is not yet implemented; requirement is to record each access event. | Medium | 2025-10-12T22:41:48.8451992Z | routes/reports.js logs admin access to SECURITY_REPORT.md (2025-10-12T23:08:05.4604257Z). | Mitigated (Monitoring) |
