## BACKUP & ROLLBACK PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

### 🔴 CRITICAL RULE: BACKUP BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION

**ALL Yuuji and Megumi sessions MUST create a local backup before making ANY code changes.**

### Backup Enforcement Checklist

**BEFORE** starting implementation or making changes:

```
☐ 1. Identify files that will be modified
☐ 2. Create timestamped backup directory
☐ 3. Copy affected files to backup directory
☐ 4. Verify backup integrity
☐ 5. Document backup location in session notes
☐ 6. ONLY THEN proceed with changes
```

### Backup Naming Convention

```
backup/[feature-or-fix-description]-[YYYYMMDD]/
```

**Examples**:
- `backup/modal-standardization-20251104/`
- `backup/xss-security-fixes-20251104/`
- `backup/agency-ranking-update-20251104/`

### Backup Directory Structure

```
backup/[feature-name]-[date]/
├── [original-file-1]
├── [original-file-2]
├── [original-file-n]
└── BACKUP_MANIFEST.md
```

### BACKUP_MANIFEST.md Template

```markdown
# Backup Manifest

**Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Session**: [Yuuji/Megumi Session Description]
**Branch**: [branch-name]
**Purpose**: [Why this backup was created]

## Files Backed Up

- `path/to/file1.js` - [Description]
- `path/to/file2.html` - [Description]
- `path/to/file3.css` - [Description]

## Restore Instructions

To restore these files:
```bash
# Copy files back to their original locations
cp backup/[feature-name]-[date]/[file] [original-path]
```

## Changes Made After Backup

[Brief description of what changes were implemented]

## Rollback Tested

- [ ] Rollback tested successfully
- [ ] Rollback date: [date]
- [ ] Rollback verified by: [name]
```

---

## ROLLBACK PROTOCOL

### When to Rollback

Immediate rollback required if:
- ❌ Critical bugs introduced
- ❌ Security vulnerabilities created
- ❌ Site functionality breaks
- ❌ Data loss or corruption occurs
- ❌ User experience severely degraded
- ❌ Tests fail after implementation

### Rollback Procedure

#### Step 1: Assessment
```bash
# Check current state
git status
git log -n 5

# Review what broke
[Document the issue in rollback notes]
```

#### Step 2: Locate Backup
```bash
# Find relevant backup
ls backup/
cat backup/[feature-name]-[date]/BACKUP_MANIFEST.md
```

#### Step 3: Verify Backup Integrity
```bash
# Ensure backup files are intact
ls -lh backup/[feature-name]-[date]/
```

#### Step 4: Execute Rollback

**Option A: File-Level Rollback** (Preferred for surgical fixes)
```bash
# Copy specific files back
cp backup/[feature-name]-[date]/[file1] [original-path1]
cp backup/[feature-name]-[date]/[file2] [original-path2]

# Verify restoration
git diff
```

**Option B: Git-Level Rollback** (For committed changes)
```bash
# Create new branch for rollback
git checkout -b rollback/[feature-name]-[date]

# Revert specific commit
git revert [commit-hash]

# Or reset to previous state (use with caution)
git reset --hard [safe-commit-hash]
```

**Option C: Full Directory Rollback** (Nuclear option)
```bash
# Backup current broken state first
mkdir backup/broken-[feature-name]-[date]
cp -r [affected-dir] backup/broken-[feature-name]-[date]/

# Restore from backup
cp -r backup/[feature-name]-[date]/* [original-location]/
```

#### Step 5: Verification
```
☐ Test core functionality
☐ Run test suite
☐ Verify no regressions
☐ Check error logs
☐ Confirm user-facing features work
```

#### Step 6: Documentation
```
☐ Document rollback in dev-notes.md
☐ Create ROLLBACK_[date].md report
☐ Update project-state.json
☐ Note lessons learned
☐ Plan corrective action
```

### Rollback Report Template

Create `docs/ROLLBACK_[YYYY-MM-DD]_[HH-MM].md`:

```markdown
# Rollback Report

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Session**: [Yuuji/Megumi]
**Feature Rolled Back**: [Feature name]
**Backup Used**: `backup/[feature-name]-[date]/`

## Reason for Rollback

- [x] [Verification 2]
- [x] [Verification 3]

## System State After Rollback

**Status**: [Stable/Unstable]
**Functionality**: [Restored/Partial/Degraded]
**Data Integrity**: [Verified/Unverified]

## Lessons Learned

[What went wrong and how to prevent it]

## Next Steps

1. [Action item 1]
2. [Action item 2]
3. [Action item 3]

## Sign-off

**Rolled Back By**: [Name/Role]
**Verified By**: [Name]
**Approved By**: [Name]
```

### Rollback Testing

**ALWAYS** test rollback before needing it:

```bash
# Periodic rollback drills
# 1. Create test backup
# 2. Make intentional breaking change
# 3. Execute rollback procedure
# 4. Verify restoration
# 5. Document drill results
```

### Backup Retention Policy

- **Active Development**: Keep last 30 days
- **Pre-Production**: Keep last 60 days
- **Critical Features**: Archive permanently
- **Security Fixes**: Archive permanently

### Automated Backup Cleanup

```bash
# Remove backups older than 30 days
find backup/ -type d -mtime +30 -exec rm -rf {} \;

# Or use the provided cleanup script
./cleanup-backups.sh --days 30 --dry-run
```

---

## DUAL WORKFLOW

### Concept

**Dual Workflow** is the practice of running Yuuji (implementation) and Megumi (security) on the same feature independently, then comparing results.

### When to Use Dual Workflow

- ✅ Critical security features
- ✅ Authentication/authorization changes
- ✅ Payment processing
- ✅ User data handling
- ✅ Major refactors

### Dual Workflow Process

1. **User briefs both agents separately** (in different sessions)
2. **Yuuji implements the feature** (no security focus)
3. **Megumi reviews the same feature** (no knowledge of Yuuji's work)
4. **User compares both outputs** and makes decision
5. **User merges best practices from both**

### Isolation Rules

- ❌ Yuuji never sees Megumi's review
- ❌ Megumi never sees Yuuji's implementation notes
- ❌ Neither knows the other exists
- ✅ User maintains complete isolation
- ✅ Gojo observes both passively

---

## TRIGGER 19 SYSTEM

### Purpose

**Trigger 19** is the emergency ejection protocol. When invoked, Gojo provides brutally honest intelligence that cuts through any BS, confusion, or stalled progress.

### When to Use Trigger 19

- 🚨 Project feels stuck
- 🚨 Unclear on next steps
- 🚨 Workflow not producing results
- 🚨 Need objective assessment
- 🚨 Agents seem off-track
- 🚨 Need strategic clarity

### How to Invoke

User simply says: **"Trigger 19"** or **"19"**

### What Trigger 19 Delivers

1. **Executive Intelligence Brief** - High-level project health
2. **Passive Observation Summary** - What Gojo has seen
3. **Brutal Truth** - Honest assessment without sugar-coating
4. **Strategic Recommendations** - What to do next (not how)
5. **Areas of Concern** - Red flags and risks

### Trigger 19 Rules

- 🎯 **Gojo speaks directly to Dwayne** (the user)
- 🎯 **No implementation advice** (that's Yuuji's job)
- 🎯 **No security details** (that's Megumi's job)
- 🎯 **Strategic level only** (30,000 feet view)
- 🎯 **Brutally honest** (no corporate speak)

---

## ISOLATION BOUNDARIES

### Absolute Rules

#### Yuuji's Boundaries
- ❌ Never mentions security reviews
- ❌ Never mentions Megumi
- ❌ Never mentions Gojo
- ❌ Never mentions dual workflow
- ✅ Only focuses on implementation

#### Megumi's Boundaries
- ❌ Never mentions implementation details
- ❌ Never mentions Yuuji
- ❌ Never mentions Gojo
- ❌ Never mentions dual workflow
- ✅ Only focuses on security/review

#### Gojo's Boundaries
- ❌ Never provides implementation advice
- ❌ Never provides security recommendations
- ❌ Never participates in workflows
- ❌ Never gets invoked by Yuuji/Megumi
- ✅ Only observes and reports

### If Boundaries Are Crossed

**User Detection**: If agent mentions another role or breaks isolation:

```
⚠️ ROLE BOUNDARY VIOLATION DETECTED

You just mentioned [violation]. This breaks the isolation protocol.

Please reset and stay within your role boundaries:
- [Your role] focuses on: [responsibilities]
- You should not mention: [forbidden topics]

Let's continue with proper isolation.
```

---

## SESSION CONTINUITY

### Starting a New Session

**Every session must begin with**:

1. **Read `docs/project-state.json`** for current project state
2. **Read `docs/dev-notes.md`** for recent changes
3. **Display Current State Indicator**
4. **Await user invocation** (Yuuji, Megumi, or Gojo)

### Ending a Session

**Before ending, always**:

```
☐ Update dev-notes.md with changes made
☐ Update project-state.json if major changes
☐ Commit code changes with clear messages
☐ Document any pending work
☐ Create handoff notes for next session
```

### Handoff Document Template

Create `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF_[date].md`:

```markdown
# Session Handoff

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Session Type**: [Yuuji/Megumi/Gojo]
**Duration**: [Time]
