## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Tip 1: Log In First (Optional)
While you can now click "Leave a Review" without being logged in, you can also log in at any time using the buttons in the top right corner. This way, the review form opens immediately when you click "Leave a Review".

### Tip 2: Check Past Reviews First
Want to see what others have said before leaving your own review? Click **"View Past Reviews"** first to read existing reviews, then click **"Leave a Review"** when you're ready.

### Tip 3: Cancel Anytime
If you change your mind while filling out a review:
- Click the **"Cancel"** button (it replaces "Leave a Review" when the form is open)
- Your partial review won't be saved or submitted
- The form closes and you can try again later

### Tip 4: Post-Review Viewing
After submitting your review:
- The form automatically closes
- Your review is immediately included in the average rating
- To see your review appear in the list, click **"View Past Reviews"**
- You'll see your review at the top with your profile picture!

## 🎯 Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to log in before clicking "Leave a Review"?
**A:** No! You can click "Leave a Review" first. If you're not logged in, we'll show you login options. After logging in, you'll automatically return to the same agency with the review form open.

### Q: Why do I need to log in at all?
**A:** We require authentication to ensure all reviews come from real J-1 participants. This maintains the authenticity and trustworthiness of the reviews on JamWatHQ.

### Q: What happens to my review form if I close the browser during login?
**A:** Your progress might be lost if you close the browser. We recommend completing the entire process in one session. However, if you return to the site after logging in, you can simply click "Leave a Review" again to start fresh.

### Q: Where is my review after I submit it?
**A:** Your review is immediately saved to the database and included in the agency's average rating. To see it displayed:
1. Click **"View Past Reviews"** on the same agency
2. Your review will appear at the top of the list (most recent first)
3. You'll see your Google profile picture (or your initial) next to your name

### Q: Can I see past reviews without leaving one?
**A:** Yes! Click **"View Past Reviews"** on any agency card to read reviews from other users. You don't need to submit your own review first.

### Q: Why are the buttons in a different order now?
**A:** We've reorganized the buttons to put the most common action first. Since more people want to leave reviews than view existing ones, **"Leave a Review"** is now the first button you'll see. This makes the interface more intuitive!

### Q: Will past reviews automatically appear after I submit mine?
**A:** No. After submitting your review, the card returns to its normal expanded view. This gives you a clean slate. If you want to see your review (and others), click **"View Past Reviews"** manually.
